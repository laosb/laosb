  <p><b>*1: </b>A refactor is pending.</p>
  <p><b>*2: </b>I check that very public one at a once-per-month frequency basis (not guranteed). That is said, if you happened to know other addresses, it's encouraged to contact me using those ones instead, since I usually check less public inboxes more frequently.</p>
  <p><b>*3: </b>Don't ask this specific problem, seriously. A private AMA method is planned, but not yet. You can ask me on Telegram directly, though.</p>
